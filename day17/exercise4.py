# Exercise 4: Social Media Application
# Create classes to represent a social media application. You should have classes for User, Post, and Comment.
# Users can create posts and comment on each other's posts.

# Hint: Use composition to represent the relationships between classes (e.g., a Post has a User and multiple Comments).
