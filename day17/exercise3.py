# Exercise 3: Online Shopping System
# Create classes to represent a simple online shopping system.
# You should have classes for Customer, Product, Cart, and Order.
# The Cart class should allow customers to add and remove products before placing an order.

# Hint: Consider using aggregation to represent the relationships between classes (e.g., a Customer has a Cart).
