# Exercise 1: Bank Management System
# Create a Bank class that manages multiple BankAccount instances.
# The Bank class should allow customers to open new accounts, deposit, withdraw, and transfer money between accounts.
# Each BankAccount should have an account number and an account holder.

# Hint: Implement a dictionary in the Bank class to map account numbers to BankAccount instances.
