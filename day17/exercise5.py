# Exercise 5: Inventory Management System
# Create a class called InventoryItem to represent an item in an inventory management system.
# The InventoryItem should have attributes like name, quantity, and price.
# Implement methods to add, remove, and update items in the inventory.

# Hint: Consider using a dictionary in the Inventory class to map item names to InventoryItem instances.
