# Exercise 2: Shape Hierarchy
# Create a hierarchy of shape classes: Shape (base class), Circle, Square, and Triangle (derived classes).
# The base class should have common attributes like color and area calculation methods.
# Each derived class should implement its area calculation method.

# Hint: Use inheritance to define the relationships between the base and derived classes.
