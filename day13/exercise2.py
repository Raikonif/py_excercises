# Unique Elements
# Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the original list.
# Do not use any built-in functions or libraries.

# Hints:
# Define a function called get_unique_elements(numbers) that takes a list of numbers as input
# and returns a new list containing only the unique elements.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers and check if each element is already present in the new list before adding it.
