# Palindrome Checker
# Instructions
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and checks if it is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word that is the same when read forwards and backwards.

# Hints:
# Use string slicing to reverse the word and check if it matches the original word.
# Define a function called is_palindrome(word) that takes a word as input and returns True if it is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
# Use a while loop to continue asking the user for a word until a palindrome is entered.
